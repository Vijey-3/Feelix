## Title of the Project
Small description about the project like one below
The integration of a chatbot within a hostel booking system, aimed at streamlining the reservation process for students and improving the overall user experience.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Tailored Chatbot for Hostel Booking System is a project designed to integrate a chatbot that leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user queries to the hostel booking system. Traditional hostel booking processes are often time-consuming and involve manual searches and extensive communication with hostel staff. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by creating an easy-to-use chatbot interface that assists students in addressing inquiries.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Implements advance neural network method.
- A framework based application for deployment purpose.
- High scalability.
- Less time complexity.
- A specific scope of Chatbot response model, using json data format.

## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
* Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
* Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the sign language detection system.
* Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow for model training, MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition.
* Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV is essential for efficient image processing and real-time hand gesture recognition.
* Version Control: Implementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.
* IDE: Use of VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.
* Additional Dependencies: Includes scikit-learn, TensorFlow (versions 2.4.1), TensorFlow GPU, OpenCV, and Mediapipe for deep learning tasks.
