## Title of the Project
**Feelix – Emotion-Based Coping Assistance and Wellness Support System**

A digital wellness system designed to help users manage their emotions through guided coping strategies, interactive tools, and an intelligent recommendation system that enhances emotional well-being.

## About
Feelix is an intelligent emotional wellness platform that provides users with step-by-step coping strategies, personalized guidance, and interactive tools such as breathing timers, grounding exercises, soothing music, and a psychologist-style chatbot.
